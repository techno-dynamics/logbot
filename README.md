# LogBot

LogBot is a Discord utility bot meant to help organizations using Discord to track organizational
activities, proposals, decisions, and reviews (known as *logs*).

The bot is currently being rewritten using Discord slash commands and interactions.
The previous, unmaintained version of LogBot can be found in the v1 branch.
